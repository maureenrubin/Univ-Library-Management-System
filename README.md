ðŸŒ¸ University Library Management System ðŸŒ¸
Nov 2024 - Feb 202
I developed this application for university students to manage the library more efficiently. My goal was to create a system that simplifies the book borrowing process, making it easier for students to borrow and return books. The system also helps admins or librarian track borrowed books, manage inventory, and generate reports. 

Creating this project, I clearly understood how to manage tables and relationships in a database using Entity Framework Core 6. I also learned how to implement CRUD operations, handle data efficiently, and design a user-friendly interface in .NET WinForms. This experience improved my problem-solving skills and gave me a deeper understanding of database management and desktop application development.

However, this development was not completed because I need to be focused in out capstone and my time was limited.
